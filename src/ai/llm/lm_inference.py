            Life: A number from 1 to 5, with low values (1) indicating low life, medium values (2) indicating medium life, and high values (3) indicating high life.

            Consumption: A number from 1 to 3, with low values (1) indicating low consumption, medium values (2) indicating medium consumption, and high values (3) indicating high consumption.

            Power: A number from 1 to 5, with low values (1-2) indicating low power, medium values (3-4) indicating medium power, and a high value (5) indicating high power

            Vision: A number from 1 to 4, with low values (1) indicating low vision, medium values (2-3) indicating medium vision, and high values (4) indicating high vision.

            You should interpret the user's description and adjust the values for each characteristic accordingly. If the user describes a positive aspect of the character, it should result in high values for the related characteristics. If the user describes a negative aspect, it should result in low values. 
            If the user does not mention a particular phsic aspect, you should assign medium values to that characteristic.
